# Authentication System Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Firebase Services (src/lib/firebase-services.ts)**
- ✅ Updated all `setDoc` operations to use `{ merge: true }` to preserve existing data
  - `ensureUserProfileExists()` - Always merges user profile data
  - `saveOrder()` - Uses merge to preserve order data
  - `saveInquiry()` - Uses merge to preserve inquiry data
  - `saveProduct()` - Uses merge and preserves createdAt timestamp
  
- ✅ Verified UID-based queries
  - `getUserOrders()` - Queries by `userId` field
  - `getUserInquiries()` - Queries by `userId` field
  - Added logging for debugging

- ✅ ADMIN_UID configured: `IlrRPiSdkJdtwHpnmTk1E0Q2X3f1`

### 2. **User Authentication Context (src/context/UserAuthContext.tsx)**
- ✅ Email/Password authentication with OTP verification
- ✅ No anonymous authentication used
- ✅ User profile created with verified status after OTP verification
- ✅ Login enhanced to:
  - Load user profile after email/password authentication
  - Verify user is marked as verified in Firestore
  - Load user's orders and inquiries
  - Cache profile in localStorage
  
- ✅ Session persistence:
  - `onAuthStateChanged` listener restores user session
  - Fetches profile from Firestore when auth state changes
  - Automatically loads orders and inquiries

### 3. **Owner Authentication Context (src/context/OwnerAuthContext.tsx)**
- ✅ Email/Password login (already using, not anonymous)
- ✅ Validates UID matches ADMIN_UID
- ✅ Creates/updates admin profile in Firestore
- ✅ Checks for admin role in user_profiles

### 4. **Admin Dashboard (src/pages/OwnerDashboard.tsx)**
- ✅ Properly protects admin routes:
  - Checks `isAuthenticated && isAdmin`
  - Validates `userId === ADMIN_UID`
  - Redirects to login if not authorized
- ✅ Tabs for Products, Orders, and Inquiries management

### 5. **Components**
- ✅ SignupForm - Collects email, password, fullName, phoneNumber
- ✅ OTPVerification - Verifies with 123456 test OTP
- ✅ LoginForm - Email/password authentication
- ✅ MyOrders - Displays user's orders from context
- ✅ MyEnquiries - Displays user's inquiries from context

## Authentication Flow

### Sign Up
1. User enters: fullName, email, password, phoneNumber
2. Firebase creates account with email/password
3. User profile created in Firestore with uid, fullName, email, phoneNumber, verified: false
4. OTP (123456) sent for phone verification
5. User verifies OTP
6. Profile updated with verified: true
7. User is logged in with their UID

### Login
1. User enters email and password
2. Firebase authenticates the user
3. `onAuthStateChanged` listener fires
4. User profile is loaded from Firestore using UID
5. Orders and inquiries are queried using UID
6. Data is displayed in UI
7. Session persists in localStorage

### Session Persistence
- When app reloads, `onAuthStateChanged` listener restores the session
- User profile is fetched from Firestore using the UID
- Orders and inquiries are automatically loaded
- **Same UID is maintained** across sessions

## Critical Requirements Met

✅ **Same UID Across Sessions**
- Firebase Auth generates UID once during signup
- Same UID used consistently across all Firestore documents
- Session persistence uses auth state, not manual UID lookup

✅ **Data Persistence**
- Orders linked to userId (which is the UID)
- Inquiries linked to userId (which is the UID)
- When user logs in again, data is queried by the same UID

✅ **Admin Access**
- Admin account: owner@cablehq.com
- Admin UID: IlrRPiSdkJdtwHpnmTk1E0Q2X3f1
- Admin can manage all orders, inquiries, and products
- Dashboard protected by UID verification

✅ **OTP System**
- Test OTP: 123456
- Used for phone number verification during signup
- Phone number stored and linked to UID

✅ **Firestore Rules Compliance**
- All operations use UID-based filtering
- Admin access controlled via ADMIN_UID check
- merge: true prevents data loss

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Sign up with email, password, fullName, phoneNumber
- [ ] Verify OTP with 123456
- [ ] Complete signup and verify user can see empty orders/inquiries
- [ ] Create an order or inquiry
- [ ] Logout and login again
- [ ] Verify same user appears with their orders/inquiries
- [ ] Test admin login with owner@cablehq.com
- [ ] Verify admin can view all orders and inquiries
- [ ] Test that different users see different data

## Firestore Schema

```
users/{uid} (handled by Firebase Auth)

user_profiles/{uid}:
  uid
  fullName
  email
  phoneNumber
  verified: boolean
  createdAt: serverTimestamp()
  updatedAt: serverTimestamp()

orders/{orderId}:
  userId: uid (critical for queries)
  orderNumber
  customerName
  ...
  createdAt
  updatedAt

inquiries/{inquiryId}:
  userId: uid (critical for queries)
  userType
  ...
  createdAt
  updatedAt

products/{productId}:
  id
  name
  ...
  createdAt (only set once)
  updatedAt

owners/{uid}:
  uid
  email
  role: "admin"
  isAdmin: true
```

## Recommended Firestore Rules

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    function isSignedIn() {
      return request.auth != null;
    }
    
    function isAdmin() {
      return request.auth != null &&
        (request.auth.uid == "IlrRPiSdkJdtwHpnmTk1E0Q2X3f1" ||
         exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/owners/$(request.auth.uid)));
    }
    
    match /user_profiles/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if isSignedIn() && (request.auth.uid == userId || isAdmin());
    }
    
    match /products/{productId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create, update, delete: if isAdmin();
    }
    
    match /orders/{orderId} {
      allow create: if isSignedIn() && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      allow read, update, delete: if isAdmin() || resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    match /inquiries/{inquiryId} {
      allow create: if isSignedIn() && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      allow read, update, delete: if isAdmin() || resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    match /owners/{ownerId} {
      allow read, write: if isAdmin();
    }
    
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

## Notes

1. **Phone Number Login**: Currently not implemented as separate flow. Phone is verified during signup and stored in profile. Primary login is email + password.

2. **API Endpoints**: The admin dashboard uses API endpoints (`/api/orders`, `/api/admin/enquiries`). Ensure these endpoints properly validate the ADMIN_UID.

3. **Database Migration**: If migrating from old system with different UIDs, data needs to be re-keyed under the correct Firebase auth UIDs.

4. **Testing Admin**: To test admin features, ensure the admin user is created in Firebase Auth with UID `zh5ODSgQOCgkkz74zNulyeS36XL2` and email `owner@cablehq.com`.
