## üîç Implementation Details Verified

### Authentication System
```
‚úì Sign Up Flow:
  1. User enters: fullName, email, password, phoneNumber
  2. Firebase creates auth user with auto-generated UID
  3. Firestore: user_profiles/{uid} created with verified: false
  4. OTP sent (123456 for testing)
  5. User verifies OTP
  6. Firestore: user_profiles/{uid} updated with verified: true
  7. User logged in with orders/inquiries loaded

‚úì Login Flow:
  1. User enters email and password
  2. Firebase authenticates
  3. onAuthStateChanged listener fires
  4. Firestore: user_profiles/{uid} loaded
  5. Orders and inquiries queried using uid
  6. User logged in with data populated
  
‚úì Session Persistence:
  1. onAuthStateChanged maintains session
  2. User profile cached in localStorage
  3. Same UID maintained across sessions
  4. Orders and inquiries auto-loaded on app restart
```

### Data Persistence
```
‚úì Orders:
  - Linked to userId (which is the Firebase UID)
  - All writes use merge: true
  - Queries filter by userId
  - Accessible only to order creator or admin
  
‚úì Inquiries:
  - Linked to userId (which is the Firebase UID)
  - All writes use merge: true
  - Queries filter by userId
  - Accessible only to inquiry creator or admin
  
‚úì User Profiles:
  - Stored under uid as document ID
  - Contains: uid, fullName, email, phoneNumber, verified
  - Updated via merge: true
  - Persisted across sessions
```

### Admin System
```
‚úì Admin Configuration:
  - Email: owner@cablehq.com
  - Password: SecurePass123!
  - UID: zh5ODSgQOCgkkz74zNulyeS36XL2
  
‚úì Admin Features:
  - View all orders (not filtered by userId)
  - View all inquiries (not filtered by userId)
  - Manage products
  - Update order/inquiry statuses
  
‚úì Admin Authorization:
  - Checked in OwnerAuthContext
  - Verified in OwnerDashboard
  - Should be enforced in Firestore rules
```

## üß™ Pre-Deployment Testing Checklist

### User Registration & Login
- [ ] Sign up with new email works
- [ ] OTP verification with 123456 works
- [ ] User profile appears in Firestore with correct UID
- [ ] Login with same credentials works
- [ ] Same UID appears after login
- [ ] Logout and re-login maintains same UID
- [ ] Session persists after page refresh
- [ ] Logout clears all user data

### Data Persistence
- [ ] Create order ‚Üí order appears in Firestore with correct userId
- [ ] User sees their orders after login
- [ ] User doesn't see other users' orders
- [ ] Create inquiry ‚Üí inquiry appears in Firestore with correct userId
- [ ] User sees their inquiries after login
- [ ] User doesn't see other users' inquiries
- [ ] Orders/inquiries persist after logout/login

### Multiple Users
- [ ] Create User A and place order
- [ ] Create User B and place order
- [ ] User A sees only User A's order
- [ ] User B sees only User B's order
- [ ] Admin sees all orders

### Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Admin can log in with owner@cablehq.com / SecurePass123!
- [ ] Admin sees all orders (not filtered)
- [ ] Admin sees all inquiries (not filtered)
- [ ] Admin can manage products
- [ ] Admin can update order statuses
- [ ] Admin can update inquiry statuses
- [ ] Regular user cannot access admin dashboard

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Same user logs in from two browsers simultaneously
- [ ] User logs in, clears cookies, logs in again
- [ ] User changes password (if implemented)
- [ ] User clicks "Forgot Password"
- [ ] Network disconnects during order creation
- [ ] Concurrent orders from same user work correctly

## üîê Firestore Rules Setup

Before going live, ensure these rules are applied in Firebase Console:

1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Your Project
2. Click "Firestore Database" ‚Üí "Rules"
3. Replace content with rules from `AUTHENTICATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
4. Click "Publish"

**Critical Rules:**
```
‚úì user_profiles: Read/write own profile or admin
‚úì products: Public read, admin write only
‚úì orders: User can only see/edit own orders, admin can see all
‚úì inquiries: User can only see/edit own inquiries, admin can see all
‚úì owners: Only admin can access
```

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying to Production

- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Firestore rules are applied
- [ ] Admin user created in Firebase Auth
  - UID: zh5ODSgQOCgkkz74zNulyeS36XL2
  - Email: owner@cablehq.com
  - Password: SecurePass123! (change in production)
- [ ] Admin profile created in Firestore under user_profiles/{admin_uid}
- [ ] OTP provider configured (currently static 123456)
- [ ] Password reset email configured
- [ ] Error logging configured (Sentry/LogRocket)
- [ ] Environment variables set correctly
- [ ] API endpoints secured with Firebase Auth tokens
- [ ] CORS policies configured if needed
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Backup and restore procedures tested

### Recommended Post-Deployment

1. Monitor Firebase Auth for failed login attempts
2. Check Firestore for proper data structure
3. Verify user orders/inquiries load correctly
4. Test admin dashboard access
5. Monitor console for errors
6. Check email delivery (password reset)

## üìä Configuration Summary

### Firebase Project Settings
- Project ID: wirebazar-c1322
- Auth Methods: Email/Password ‚úì
- Firestore Collections: user_profiles, orders, inquiries, products, owners
- Admin UID: zh5ODSgQOCgkkz74zNulyeS36XL2

### Application Settings
- OTP Test Code: 123456
- Session Storage: localStorage + Firebase Auth state
- Data Merge Mode: All Firestore writes use merge: true
- Query Filter: All user data queried by userId (UID)

## üêõ Debugging Guide

### If Users Get New UID Every Login
1. Check Firebase Auth console for duplicate users
2. Verify email uniqueness enforcement
3. Check UserAuthContext login function
4. Monitor onAuthStateChanged listener
5. Check localStorage for UID conflicts

### If Orders/Inquiries Don't Appear
1. Verify userId field exists in Firestore documents
2. Check that userId matches user.id (which is Firebase UID)
3. Verify user is logged in (not just authenticated)
4. Check browser console for query errors
5. Ensure user.verified === true in profile

### If Admin Can't Access Dashboard
1. Verify Firebase UID matches zh5ODSgQOCgkkz74zNulyeS36XL2
2. Check user_profiles entry for admin
3. Verify admin role/isAdmin flag
4. Check Firestore rules are published
5. Verify localStorage has auth token
